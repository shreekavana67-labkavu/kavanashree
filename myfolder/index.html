<h2>Real shadows</h2>
<p> Real shadow is nothing but a shadow person (also known as a shadow figure or black mass) is a popular subject in circles of the paranormal and supernatural detailing beings resembling animate human shadows, sometimes interpreted as the presence of a spirit.Shadow people are a bit of an enigma in the paranormal community,professional witch and psychic Ren√©e Watt tells Bustle.They are often thought of as ghosts or a collection of negative energy but as is true with most paranormal phenomena, there is no finite answer. According to Watt, shadow people can appear in different forms and may even indicate that someone is under a psychic attack. Many paranormal experts also theorize that there may be a connection between shadow people and extra-terrestrial life and that these beings could be other-worldly in origin or have a correlation with alleged alien abduction experiences.</p>
